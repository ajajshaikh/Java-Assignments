The user first needs to login from the login page.

web Container : Tomcat
URL : http://localhost:8080/AjajShaikh_Nov2018_Part_2_1/login.jsp
	->username : cotiviti
	->password : cotiviti

After successful validation of username and password the login.jsp page will redirect to 
visitcount.jsp page with URL : http://localhost:8080/AjajShaikh_Nov2018_Part_2_1/visitcount.jsp

After each refresh and every time the "visitcount" page is visited the page counter will increment.
If the user is logged out and again after new login the count will continue to increase from the last count.

If the user presses "back" button from the "visitcount" page then he/she will be redirected to the login page again
in order to provide user security.
